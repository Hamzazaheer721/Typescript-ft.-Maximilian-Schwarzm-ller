// One of the most interesting options in tsconfig is compilerOptions
// We can set our javascript version in target based on the version of javascript which we want to use

// ==> There is another Option of lib : []
// ==> If we keep it as it is then everything that target: "es6", javascript targetted version has will be accessible in our project
// ==> Even dom and everything will become available
// ==> if enable the lib: [] and use it then we will get error on using dom and now we will have to specifically mention that we want to use dom
